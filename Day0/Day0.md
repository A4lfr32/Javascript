The porpose of the day0 is mainly landing and scope of javascript, also a first view of a schedule to learn javascript.

Javascript (JS) begun as the code of frontend websites, at the client side. Now it is used in (meme)
*The relation with Java is only commercial, the same company Netscape corporation and Sun Mycrosystem tried to apply java in the web with their Netscape browser, but with individuallss snippets of code that allows to make individual tasks, but ended building a new lenguage Livescript which was released as web lenguage as javascript. This about 1995.

The competitor of Netscape was Microsoft which pretended to do the same at 1996 releasing "Microsoft internet explorer", made JScript with reverse engineering help. This competence had a problem, as they were close-source the webs developed in netscape didn't work in internet explorer and viceversa.

Netscape achieved to submit the javascript to Ecman international making a ECMAScript standar for interoperatibility (with microsoft help), achieved it to work not only in netscape navigator. Meanwhile JScript (microsoft livescript version) rised popularity and microsoft stop collaborating with ECMAScript 4. Then comes the sucesor of netscape in 2004, Mozilla improving once again ECMAScript (for XML).

The intereting thin is aside the ECMA standar work,  Jesse James Garrett released a white paper (2005) with the first touch of AJAX. This time open-source (no microsoft vs netscape vs mozilla) was growing created new libraries as: Jquery, Prototype, Dojo, Toolkit and MooTools. The first days of WEB 2.0, because this opensource worked in even listeners, in other words, allowing client to interact with website on their demand behavior. Now client have a way of excecuting individual scripts wih events.

Google with chrome with "Just in time" (JIT) innovation take adventage with fastest browser and made ECMAScript 5 possible in 2009., thans to their J8 engine, which ended being used in Node js for server applications by Ryan Dahl without needing a browser.

ECMAScript 6 comesin 2015.

Note: Javascript runs in a sandbox, which isolate internet from local, so you couldn't use javascript in browser to move folders or control the mouse, etc... There are exceptions  like controlling sound but this actually made with external APIs, not javascript itself.

Key concepts:
* Interoperatibility
* Script lenguage
* API

Goals:
* Desktop app with Javascript (maybe electron js)
* Mobile app (I still don't know how)
* Make an API-REST
* Deploy the API-Rest in the cloud (one in google, other in microsfot azure, maybe also in Amazon)
* 3 web browser basic apps, 1 by month.
* Solve a challenge dially in codewars: javascript
* Try to answer a basic question about javascript in stakoverflow, you learn unknow questions and google the answer.
* Maybe THREE js AP, explore others animation libraries.
* Canvas, fabric js.
* Programm a game
* A simple geogebra project using javascript

Without the following two rules, Javascript could be used by malicous people.
1. scripts runs isolated in a sandbox for web-related actions, thus is imposible to create/modify/remove files of your computer through web. 
    What happens in the browser, stays  in the browser
2. Same-origin policy, a website can access to information of other website, it even apply for local files.

It is very common try to read a image in a folder and get an error because cross-site vulnerabilities.
