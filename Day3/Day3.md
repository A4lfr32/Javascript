# Data types
* Strings
* Numbers
* Booleans
* Arrays
* Objects
* undefined

Before 2015
* Var
Var keeps the variable in the run-time, even if it gets out the initial scope.
After 2015
* Let
* const
let only works in the scope leve it was declarated, 'let' block the access to redeclare that variable in the same scope, var do not.

## one statement multiple variables.
``` javascript
let person = "John Doe",
carName = "Volvo",
price = 200;
```
